It effectively kills bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores to ensure instruments are safe for use in surgical and diagnostic procedures. Available in various sizes and configurations, autoclaves provide reliable, quick sterilization cycles with precise control and safety features. They play a key role in infection control in hospitals, dental clinics, pharmaceutical production, and research labs. With features such as digital timers, pressure gauges, and safety interlocks, autoclaves ensure compliance with health regulations and prevent cross-contamination."
